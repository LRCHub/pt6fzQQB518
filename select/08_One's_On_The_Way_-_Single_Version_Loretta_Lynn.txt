They say to have her hair done lift life all the way to france
And Jackie seen in a disco tech doin' a brand new dance
And the whitehouse social season should be glittering and gay,
But here in topeka the rain is a fallin', the facet is a drippin' and the kids are a ballin', one of them is a toddlin' and one is a crawlin' and one's on the way.
I'm glad that rachell welts just signed a million dollar pact
And Debbies out in Vegas workin' out a brand new act,
While the tv's showin' newly weds, a real fine game to play,
But here in topeka the screen door's a bangin', the coffees boillin' over, and the morse needs a hangin', one wants a cookie and one wants a changin' and ones on the way,
"Now what was I doin'?
Jimmy get away from there!

"Hello honey, what's that you say?
You're bringing a few old army buddies home?!
Your callin' from a bar?!" Get away from there! "

The girls in new york city they all march for womens lived
And better homes and gardens shows a modern way to live
And the pill may change the world tomorrow, but mean while today
Here in topeka the flies are a buzzin', the dog is a barkin' and the floor needs a scrubbin', one needs a spankin' and one needs a huggin', Lord...
Ones on the way .
"Oh, gee .
I hope it ain't twins again ."
