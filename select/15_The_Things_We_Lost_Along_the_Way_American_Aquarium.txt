I've been running in circles most of my days
And I still can't find a path that keeps me out of my own way
From a long line of losers with bad luck in their veins
Carrying the weight of a lifetime of mistakes

They say time is the cruelest trick of all
You're riding high, next thing you know your back's against the wall
You can't take it with you when you go
We've all gotta die someday
When it all turns to black, we'll be left looking back
At all the things we've lost along the way

Its a razor thin line between what's wrong and right
And the dark road doesn't seem so dark if you've never seen the light
I wish I had learned to let go, like a bird upon a breeze
Back before I learned to say no to
The things that brought me to my knees
