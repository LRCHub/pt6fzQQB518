I love you just the way God made you
Girl, he don't make mistakes
What you call your imperfections
I call beautiful, babe
(Tell 'em, Blanc)

The way your hair's in a mess in the morning
When you open your eyes
The way an hour goes by
When you say that you'll be ready in five, yeah, uh
The little dimple on the side of your smile
When you're laughing
At a movie that you've seen about a thousand times
You know, girl, that I can't lie

I love you just the way God made you
Girl, he don't make mistakes
What you call your imperfections
I call beautiful, babe
So let my eyes be your mirror
And you're bound to see it too
'Cause I was made for loving
Just the way God made you

Just the way, just the way
Just the way, just the way
God made you
(God made you)
Just the way, just...
