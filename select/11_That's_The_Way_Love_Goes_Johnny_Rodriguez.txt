I've been throwing horseshoes over my left shoulder
I've spent most of my life looking for that four-leaf clover

Yet you run with me chasing my rainbow
Honey I love you too that's the way love goes

That's the way love goes babe back to music god made
Over the whole wide world to sing it never gets old it only grows
Losing makes me sorry you say honey don't worry
Honey I love you too that's the way love goes
Honey I love you too that's the way love goes
