Oh, It’s like I’m still fifteen
Just stuck in a daydream of what it could be
Ahh ~
Oh, cause you make me crazy
I found myself outside your door tonight
Can you let me in?
You, you’ve been dropping some hints
But there ain’t no action
Don’t worry babe, I know what you meant!
Call your landline and you pick up
It’s so silent but know it’s love
Ring Ring, I’ma keep on callin cause
I can’t stop it
This could be a love story
Boy don’t say no, you’re made just for me
I promise, I’m not like this normally
I gotta, gotta have you oh!

Promise that you’ll be my baby
I’ll tie you up, you won’t ever ever ever

Right with me

Oh you’re so cute when you’re runnin
How’d you cut the rope? You’re so funny
Baby you don’t gotta pretend
Scared? I know you like it!
I notice all of your quirks
How you laugh when it hurts
I’ll save you baby, those girls can’t hurt you
no more, so here’s my plan!
Cut the service off of your phone
Baby, I want you alone
