I can tell by the way
I can tell by the way
I can see...
Everytime I look into your eyes That you don't care a thing about those other guys Without words You make me understand what's on your mind The rhythm of your body close to mine I can tell by the way you dance That you're gonna love me tonight
Sometimes it's cold,.
Some-times it's hot Love's either right or it's wrong Feelin' so good,.
Love.
You a lot Right here beside me is where you belong
I don't care...
If everybody knows the way I feel Until the dream of holdin' you is real I can tell by the way you dance That you're gonna love me tonight
Some-times it's cold,.
Sometimes it's hot Love's either right or it's wrong Feelin' so good,.
Love.
You a lot Right here beside me is where you belong
I don't care...
If everybody knows the way I feel Un-til the dream of holdin' you is real I can tell by the way you dance That you're gonna love me tonight
I can tell by the way you dance That you're gonna love me to-night I can tell by the way you dance That you're gonna love me tonight fade...
